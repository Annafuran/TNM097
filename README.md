# TNM097

A project for the course TNM097, Image Reproduction and Image Quality at Link√∂ping University.

The project aimed to implement an algorithm based on CIELAB color metric, in order to reproduce a lego image according to an input image. The algorithm initially creates a limited 
database of lego colors, and then measures the pixel value in the input image for choosing the optimal colors for reproduction. 

The project was implemented using Matlab.
